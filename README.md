### Problem 1:
Create a h1 element with "Not this Question Again..." Create a button with "Click Me". Once it's clicked, ask the user if they want to continue being asked to quit. If they enter 'n', stop asking. If they enter anything else, ask again.

### Problem 2:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture. Put a button called "1" in your menu section and another button called "2" in your main section. Put the number 0 in your title. If you click the #1 button the title should change to "1" and the background to blue. If you click the #2 button the title should change to "2" and the background to red. Use classlist to change the background.

### Problem 3:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture. Next create four h2 tags with four different sentences in them in your main section. Create one font size function that can change the fontsize of anything you click to “1px”. Use classlist to change the fontsize.
